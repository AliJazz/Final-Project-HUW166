                <h4>PERFECT TEMPERATURE </h4>
                <p>Keep your plant’shome environment as stable as possible. Extreme changes can stress plants out. Keep the temperature between 65 and 85 degrees F, and avoid placing your plants near radiators, A/C units, and forced-air vents, which can create hot or cold drafts.</p>

                <h4>WATERING THE PLANTS</h4>
                <p>It’s better to under water your plants than to overwater. Too much water can lead to root rot. Ditch your watering schedule and water your plant only when it needs it. Check the potting mix or soil first to make sure it’s dry at least 2 inches deep below the surface. If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to do it’s thing for now.

                <h4>Keep drainage in mind </h4>
                <p>If you tend to have a heavy hand when watering your plants, keep drainage in mind. You can opt for a planter with a drainage hole and saucer, keep your plant in a grow pot nestled inside a planter, or add lava rocks to the bottom of a planter without a hole (to create crevices for excess water to flow to). Do what works best for you! Don't be afraid to try different methods for different plants.

                <h4>Choose plants based on your light</h4>
                <p>Are the plants you love the ones you can have? Our #1 rule of (green) thumb is to determine the amount of natural lightyour space receives, and to choose your plant accordingly. If you’re not sure just by looking, start by figuring out which direction your windows face.</p>

                <h4>Pick plants that work with your schedule </h4>
                <p>New to plant parenthood? A busy work schedule, sociallife, and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional plant neglect. It’s okay. Some plants can handle that kind of lifestyle. A jet-setter like yourself will enjoy the resilience of low-maintenance and drought-tolerant succulents, ZZ plants, or snake plants, all pretty low key, as long as they have enough light (bright and low light respectively). These should keep looking their best when you return from your next trip.</p>

                <h4>Raise humidity levels when needed</h4>
                <p>Staying true to your plant's natural environment will help your plant thrive indoors. Most tropical plants prefer high humidity and bright to moderate, indirect light. During the dry months of winter, grouping similar plants together helps to create a more humid microclimate. A humidifier can help too and it’s great for humans (find more ways to increase humidity levels here). On the other hand, most desert dwellers like cacti and succulents prefer dry air and bright, direct light with no shade at all. They don’t much care for humidity.

                <h4>Know when to skip the fertilizer </h4>
                <p>Be mindful when using fertilizer on your houseplants. Too much fertilizer can do more harm than good. Houseplants tend to not need fertilizer as often as outdoor plants do. If you do choose to fertilize your plant, it’s best to do so during the growing season (early spring to early fall) and follow the general rule of thumb: ‘less is more’. Most store-​bought fertilizers should be diluted with water before use.

                <h4>Shop from a reliable source</h4>
                <p>Purchase your plants from areputablesource like The Sill, your favorite local garden center, and specialty stores or florists. Purchasing from a source with plant experts on-site means they can answer all your questions. Most people who sell or work with plants love talking about them. We definitely do.</p>

                <h4>Show a little TLC at first </h4>
                <p>Once your plant has been delivered to your door or brought home from your local store, it will need a few weeks to adjust to its new environment. Show your plant a little extra attention in the beginning. Observing your plant will tell you when to water and when to not, if the temperature is too high or too low, and if it’s getting enough sun. Plus they’re so pleasing to look at.</p>

                <h4>Don’t be scared to repot</h4>
                <p>A common misconception,"repotting" does not necessarily mean putting your plant in a new planter, but rather, changing out your plant’s soil with fresh potting mix to provide new nutrients. Plants typically need to be repotted every 12 to 18 months, depending on how actively they are growing. If your plant has outgrown its current planter, you can also use this as a time to size up. Choose a planter only 1 to 3 inches larger than its current container. The idea is that your plant is not swimming in soil, which may lead you to overwater, but has a little extra space to grow.</p>
